Pretoria - The Department of Health says Aspen Pharmacare, one of the two companies supplying anti-retrovirals to government hospitals, on Friday released 30 000 packs of Tenofovir for the Limpopo depot. Further releases to the province were expected during the course of next week. This comes after Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi and Aspen Pharmacare Senior Executive Stavros Nicolaou held discussions in Johannesburg. The minister said he was happy about the increase in stock levels at the Limpopo depot. "It's an important development and it actually demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that at no point are our patients compromised. We are continuously monitoring the situation on a daily basis and I must commend Aspen for their quick response in dealing with the situation," said Motsoaledi. Earlier, the minister said there had been a decline in ARV stock levels, but this did not necessarily translate to patients not getting their ARVs. He had given out a number for patients who are currently affected by the shortage of ARVs to contact the department. The minister said the department had made an arrangement with Treasury to import 1 million units of the drugs. People affected by the drug shortage can call 012 395 8171 or 082 419 1925.
