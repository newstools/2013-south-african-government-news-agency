Pretoria - Displays of mastery and outwitting opponents were the order of the day when 96 individuals took part in the Moves for Life Chess Tournament in Nkandla. President Jacob Zuma, whose love for the game of strategy is well-known and is the patron of Moves for Life, squared off against some formidable youngsters, who had a trick or two to show him. The participants came from all over KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Present amongst the attendees were international master Watu Kobese and SA champ Kgaogelo Mosetle. The tournament was divided into two sections, one reserved for scholars, and the other open to all ages. The tournament is in its second year and plans are afoot to make it even bigger. "The President wants us to reach out to more places, particularly where there are previously disadvantaged people. Next year, we plan to move to other rural areas because people want us to, and the response has been great," tournament organiser Sandile Xulu told BuaNews. Moves for Life and KwaZulu Chess, which is co-founded by President Zuma, will from next February roll out a chess programme for schools. Ten schools in KwaZulu-Natal, including Nkandla and Richards Bay, will be among the first to be targeted. Xulu said they hoped to reach even more schools in the near future. Moves for Life is meeting with Zuma at his house in Nkandla today to plan their next move in taking the game that teaches logic and problem solving skills to even more South African children.
