Polokwane - The Limpopo government is spending nearly R20 million to build community libraries in some of the province's deep rural areas. Construction of the libraries has started in Shilubane village near Tzaneen, Mutale village outside Thohoyandou, Rapotokwane village near Bela Bela as well as Bakgoma village outside Mokopane. "The libraries will assist in educating and developing local communities, keeping the youth off the streets and decreasing the level of illiteracy," said spokesperson for the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture, Adele van der Linde. Each community library will cost R4.5 million and more than 300 jobs are expected to be created during the construction phase, she said. During a sod-turning event in Shilubane village recently, MEC Joyce Mashamba urged community members to protect the library from vandalism and theft. "Before we can talk about security that will be brought here, the community must be the guards," she said. Local matric pupil Vutomi Ndabambi said she was excited because she would no longer have to travel to town to go the library. "The community library will bring internet services, books and newspapers to our doorstep," she said. Construction of the four libraries is expected to be completed before the end of this year. Currently, there are 56 libraries in Limpopo.
