Johannesburg - Hundreds of people have gathered at Orlando Stadium in Soweto for the funeral of the late African National Congress stalwart, Albertina Sisulu. MaSisulu, who died at her Linden home in Johannesburg, is being accorded an official funeral and her remains are to be buried at Croesus Cemetery, where her husband Walter was also laid to rest in 2003. South Africans respect her for the role she played in the struggle for the country's liberation. A casket wrapped in the African National Congress flag arrived at her home in Orlando West, where a group of ANC Women's League members had been singing revolutionary songs since around 7am in the morning. Among those seen arriving at venue included President Jacob Zuma, former President Thabo Mbeki and several Cabinet ministers and premiers. At the stadium, a large cloth displaying a picture of MaSisulu is laid on the pitch with words 'nation builder and selfless leader.' Arrangements had been made for those wanting to attend the funeral, with Metrorail and the taxi industry announcing this week that trains and taxis will be available to ferry people to the stadium free of charge. There will also be Rea Vaya buses to transport people wanting to attend the funeral from various parts of the city.
