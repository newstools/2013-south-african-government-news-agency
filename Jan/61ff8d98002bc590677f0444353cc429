Pretoria - Abused women and children now have one more place to turn to, with the Tshwane One Stop Safe House officially opening its doors to those in need today. The centre, which offers accommodation to victims of abuse, is made up of three houses donated by the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality. It will, among other things, teach young people to abstain from sex and the value of education. Speaking at the opening, Executive Mayor, Kgosientso Ramokgopa, appealed to members of society to play an active role in assisting all those that are being abused. "A united front is needed in the fight against the abuse of women and children. Society should always be at the forefront in crafting the future of young people, especially those that are abused," said the mayor. He added that government and the business sector should work together to end poverty. Tshepo Molotsane, who survived abuse at the hands of her uncle, called on other young people who were being abused not to give up on their dreams. "I was abused by someone whom I trusted, I even gave up my dreams and did not know what to do," she said, holding back tears. "I felt empty and worthless." Molotsane's problems started after her mother had passed on in 2000. Her uncle offered to take care of her and her little sister. According to her, she was also sexually abused by her uncle. Her life turned for the better after she sought help from the centre.
