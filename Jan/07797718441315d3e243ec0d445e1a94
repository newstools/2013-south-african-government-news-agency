Pretoria - Crime Line, the anonymous tip-off service, is fast approaching the 2 000 mark in arrests ahead of its fifth anniversary in June. To date, more than 1 800 suspects have been arrested, thanks to tip-offs sent by the public to Crime Line. "Since our launch in 2007, Crime Line has made incredible strides in giving voice to the millions of South Africans out there by giving them a platform to blow the whistle on crime anonymously. Five years is a landmark for us and we will continue to grow the service with exciting developments planned for the future," said Head of Crime Line, Yusuf Abramjee. Police have also thrown their weight behind the initiative. "We are proud to be involved in a public-private partnership that encourages whistleblowing and allows for communities to become our eyes and ears in the fight against crime. The police are committed to further growing the partnership," said Brigadier Lindela Mashigo of the SAPS National Media Centre. Crime Line has been instrumental in the arrests of some of the country's most wanted criminals, including suspected robbers and ATM bombers. Abramjee appealed to the public to continue helping in the fight against crime by reporting information on the Crime Line's SMS line 32211, online at www.crimeline.co.za or to Crime Stop on 08600 10111. "South African citizens have a choice. We can reclaim our streets and ensure safer communities for our children. Whatever the crime, be it drug dealing, cable theft, murder, robbery, theft... If you have information that can assist the police in arresting the suspects, report it. Crime Line is anonymous, so no one will ever know who you are," said Abramjee.
