Pretoria - Census 2011 is expected to give the most thorough picture of the country, which will pave the way for decision making and resource allocation to improve peoples' lives. Addressing a public awareness launch of Census 2011 on Tuesday, Gauteng Acting Premier Mandla Nkomfe said they would work hard to ensure the best results from the census. "We are at a defining moment. We need these numbers so that we take appropriate decisions so that we also allocate resources properly. We believe that the census is an immense undertaking collecting important information from every household in the province and in the country," said Nkomfe, who is also the province's Finance MEC. Statistics SA is set to employ about 20 617 fieldworkers in Gauteng to enumerate over 3.1 million households in the province when the nationwide census commences in October 2011. The province, which has seen a lot of in-migration, vowed to ensure that every resident is aware of the upcoming census. Echoing the Acting Premier's words, Statistician General Pali Lehohla said that the census would reflect a truthful picture of what was happening in the country. Kefiloe Masiteng, the Deputy Director-General for Population and Social Statistics, said that partnerships with provinces are the basis for ensuring success of the census. "The aim of the census is to make sure that everyone is enumerated," she said, adding that if the country failed in counting its people, it would fail in other areas as well.
