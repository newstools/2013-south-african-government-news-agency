Pretoria - President Jacob Zuma met with suspended national Police Commissioner General Bheki Cele in Durban on Friday to discuss the Board of Inquiry report. "The President had called the meeting with the National Commissioner to discuss the report of the Board of Inquiry chaired by Justice Jake Moloi, which was established last year to discuss the conduct of the National Commissioner relating to police buildings lease agreements," said the Presidency in a statement on Sunday. However, the content of the discussions remains confidential and the President will announce his decision as soon as he has completed all necessary processes. In November last year, Zuma announced the establishment of the Board of Inquiry to probe allegations of misconduct by Cele and to pronounce on his fitness for office or his capacity to execute his official duties efficiently. This is in relation to the procurement of office space for police in Pretoria and Durban, and Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's findings regarding these deals. Judge Moloi presented the report to President Zuma in May.
