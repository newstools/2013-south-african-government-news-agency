Pretoria - Former President Nelson Mandela is "doing well" three days after being discharged from hospital after suffering from an acute respiratory infection. Former Rivonia trialist and prisoner at Robben Island, Andrew Mlangeni, said the statesman was doing well when he paid him a visit at his Houghton home on Sunday. "Mandela is wonderful! He's a terrific and terrible man, terrible in the sense that his spirits are high! He looks well and he was very happy to see us. I conveyed to Madiba the good wishes and prayers of the people of South Africa and the world ... that everyone is wishing him well. I want to ask people to continue to pray for him," said Mlangeni in a radio interview, this morning. Mandela was admitted to the Milpark hospital in Johannesburg last Wednesday, where he spent two-and- a-half days receiving treatment for the ailment that dates back to when he was a prisoner suffering from Tubercolosis on Robben Island. He was discharged on Friday, much to the relief of South Africans. The 92-year-old is now receiving home-based care. "The doctors are looking well after him and I want to congratulate our doctors for taking the trouble of paying particular attention to Mandela and they're saying he's reacting very well to the medical treatment they're giving him," said Mlangeni.
