Pretoria - The arrest of two men believed to be part of a syndicate which steals ARVs and sells them for use in the manufacturing of the drug "whoonga" - a highly addictive mixture containing stocrin, dagga, Strepsils and rat poison - has been welcomed by the Department of Health. According to the department, the pair were arrested in Ekurhuleni this week after police found them in possession of ARVs worth R200 000. They are believed to have had in their possession a box of viread, an antiretroviral drug that falls within the category of HIV medicines called nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and two plastic bags, each carrying about 20 batches of ARVs. The two men are to appear in the Tembisa Magistrate Court on Monday. The department said it was worried about the practice of using ARVs to manufacture "whoonga" as ARVs formed an important element in the fight against HIV and AIDS. It appealed to patients who are on ARVs to work with authorities in ensuring that these drugs do not find their way into the hands of criminals.
