Pretoria - President Jacob Zuma extended his well wishes once again to the South African National Cricket team on their first match of the Cricket World Cup against the West Indies. The tenth International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup began on the sub-continent on last Saturday and will end on 2 April. It is being hosted by India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The Proteas match, which is currently underway, has the West Indies batting first. The Proteas have undergone thorough preparations for their World Cup campaign and entered the tournament on the back of a series of successes. President Zuma called on all South Africans to support the Proteas by wearing their green cricket shirts every Friday and on match days. "Let us rally behind Graeme Smith and the rest of the Proteas. With our support, they can bowl the opposition over and out," he said. Zuma stressed that sport continues to be a vital tool in nation-building and the support our national teams raise across racial, religious and other boundaries is indicative of the deepening of our nationhood and the building of a common South African identity.
