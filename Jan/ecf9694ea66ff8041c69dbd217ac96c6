Johannesburg - Gauteng Premier Nomvula Mokonyane has called on members of the public to assist in exposing and reporting any acts of corruption detected in the public service. Responding to questions in the provincial legislature this morning, Mokonyane assured the province's citizens that her government would not tolerate any acts of corruption. "We are definitely committed to dealing with anyone involved in acts of corruption," she said. With regard to public servants doing business with government, Mokonyane said she was not opposed to public servants doing business with government but emphasized the need for them to declare their interests. She underscored the need to stick to the rules as laid out in the Senior Management Service handbook. "There are rules and regulations that must be adhered to. Anyone found on the wrong side of the law will be dealt with harshly," Mokonyane said. Mokonyane said they had in the past shown no mercy to senior managers and accounting officers found to have been involved in acts of corruption. The premier said the number of public servants doing business with the provincial government was negligible. "We cannot deny or be against people doing business with government. Rules and regulations must be adhered to and importantly, people must declare their interests," she said. Mokonyane warned that where there was corruption, they would not hesitate to act. Last year, the Gauteng provincial government hosted an anti-corruption summit in a bid to find better ways of dealing with corruption in the province. The Public Service Commission has also introduced an anti-corruption hotline to enable members of the public to report acts of corruption in government anonymously.
