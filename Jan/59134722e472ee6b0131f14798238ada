Pretoria - Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities, Lulu Xingwana, has commended the arrest of eight suspects allegedly involved in acts of child pornography. The eight suspects, all members of one family, were arrested last Thursday in Pretoria. They made a brief appearance on Monday at the Pretoria North Magistrate Court, where they are facing charges of rape, indecent assault, sexual grooming of children and possession, manufacturing and distribution of child pornography. Xingwana said the breakthrough by the police was particularly significant as it took place during the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children campaign. "The swift arrests and the court appearance of these suspects are the clearest indication that government is serious about clamping down on acts of abuse against women and children. "It is shocking and despicable that the suspects in this terrible case are family members of the children. We expect adults, in particular parents and family members, to protect children from these horrible atrocities," said Xingwana. She also urged community members to alert law enforcement authorities on suspicious acts affecting children. "In that way, we will arrest the moral decay that is eating away at our national psyche and we will create a safe environment for South African children," added the minister. The case was postponed to 8 December 2010 for bail hearing.
