Pretoria - The Limpopo branch of the South African Police Service (SAPS) has opened the doors of a new police station in Sebayeng, just outside Mankweng in Polokwane. The station offers fully fledged services such as visible policing and detective services. The new station brings to 97 the total number of police stations in Limpopo. The station is responsible for serving the communities of Dikgale, Makgoba and Makotopong which have recently been plagued by incidents of housebreaking and theft as well as robberies and assault. The Limpopo Commissioner of the SAPS, Lieutenant General Simon Mpembe, said he hoped that with more police visibility and members of the community working hand-in-hand with the police, the number of crimes would drop significantly. “From the onset, we need to emphasise that our presence is not only to reinforce a message that only law-abiding community members of Sebayeng and Mankweng should partner with police, but to also warn any criminals that their time is up.” Mpembe said the communities, in partnership with the police, had a duty to reclaim their streets. “We expect nothing but excellence from them. To the criminals: the party is over now. I have instructed the police to ensure that they harden their approach in their fight against criminals because we do not negotiate with criminals. The only language we can engage them in is through arrest and punishment. But arresting criminals is not enough; we now want more convictions and prosecutions,” said Mpembe. – SAnews.gov.za
