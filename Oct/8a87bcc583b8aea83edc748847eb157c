Pretoria - A special advisor in the legal field has been appointed by the Office of the Presidency, says President Jacob Zuma. Responding to a Parliamentary question on Monday, Zuma said the person appointed as the advisor is employed on a part-time basis and has no fixed annual remuneration. “He is paid per hours worked at the rate of R693.77 per hour. The Dispensation for the Appointment and Remuneration of Persons (special advisers) appointed to Executive Authorities on ground of policy consideration in terms of Section 12A of the Public Service Act, 1994 does not preclude special advisers from performing remunerative work outside their employment,” said President Zuma. The main duties of the incumbent are to render legal advice to the President. In terms of the Dispensation, the special adviser is precluded from serving on statutory boards or councils (or similar bodies) for which the Executive Authority is individually or collectively accountable. – SAnews.gov.za
