Pretoria - President Jacob Zuma opened the first Cabinet Lekgotla under his administration in Pretoria earlier today. The three-day meeting brings Mr Zuma and his 34 members of Cabinet, Provincial Premiers, Directors General of national and provincial departments and leading government advisors together for the first time. The Lekgotla is expected to map out government's five-year programme of action and deliberate on the implementation of five key priorities contained in the ANC Election Manifesto. This includes the creation of decent work and sustainable livelihoods, education, health, rural development, food security and land reform and the fight against crime and corruption. The decision taken during the Lekgotla will inform President Zuma's first State of the Nation Address to be delivered to a joint sitting of Parliament next week. Meanwhile, North West Premier, Maureen Modiselle will meet with her MECs, mayors, municipal managers, heads of parastatals and heads of provincial departments for an EXCO Lekgotla on Monday. The provincial government said the meeting would seek to develop an integrated programme of action for the province.
