Cape Town - Provincial Electoral Officer, Reverend Courtney Samson, says almost 5 percent of registered voters in the province had cast their ballots in the first 90 minutes of voting. "In the first hour and a half of voting, almost 151 000 people in the province had cast their ballot. He said voting was generally proceeding smoothly in the province and there had been a good voter turnout. There are more than 2.6 million voters registered in the Western Cape. Reverend Samson said about 98 percent of polling stations opened on time at 7am, with only four having experienced logistical problems. However, all polling stations were functional by 8am. Reverend Samson reminded voters that despite the delays there would be no extension of voting time and that all polling stations would close promptly at 9pm. He said he had noted a high number of Section 24 A votes in Sea Point. This part of the Electoral Act enables voters to cast their vote at a polling station outside of the district they are registered in. "Section 24 A is an exception to the rule and what is created for example, for truck drivers who would be out of their district on voting day, to give them an opportunity to vote. "The situation would be carefully monitored to ensure that the section 24A is not abused," said the Reverend.
