Bhisho - Eleven Eastern Cape schools were handed wheelbarrows, spades and hosepipes on Thursday to encourage pupils to set up gardens. As part of its 4H programme, the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development donated a wheelbarrow, five spades, five forks, five rakes, two hosepipes and five hoes to each school. The senior secondary schools included Sinovuyo, Ebenezer Majombozi, Gwaba, Lingelethu, Tsholomnqa in East London as well as Dilizilintaba, Nozalisile, Zwelimjongile, Kolomane, JM Ndindwa and Lushington in other areas. "The equipment will be very useful because we will be able to grow vegetables in our garden now," said Ebenezer Majombozi Senior Secondary School teacher, Ntombomzi Beni. Ms Beni said the programme would be especially helpful to the pupils at her school as many arrived at school with an empty stomach. "It will help to keep the hunger at bay," she said. She had accepted the equipment on behalf of the school during an official hand-over at the Bhisho Showgrounds. Departmental spokesperson Thozi Manyisana said the schools were identified by both the Departments of Education and Agriculture and Rural Development. "This forms part of a pilot project aimed at intensifying the department's 4H programme at schools, which is encouraging schools to have a garden at school." The programme will also lead to an interest in agricultural science in the schools which will in turn help the provincial economy, which is largely dependant on agriculture, Mr Manyisana said.
