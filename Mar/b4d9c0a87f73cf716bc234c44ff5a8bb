Pretoria -The Environmental Management Inspectorate (Green Scorpions) have found the four illegal health care risk medical waste disposal sites in Welkom safe for use. The Green Scorpions said the Maximus Bricks, Jonkersrus farm, Welkom showgrounds and the Harmony Gold property sites are free of any medical waste and have been rehabilitated accordingly, spokesperson Frances Craigie said on Wednesday. Craigie said they would now focus on the criminal trial. The criminal case against nine people and entities investigated for illegally dumping the waste would continue on November 29. More parties are expected to be added to the list of accused. Maximus Bricks was raided in November 2009 and a significant amount of medical waste was found to be buried on the site, including sharps, viles, syringes, drips, dirty bandages and general medical waste. The other sites were discovered after more search warrants were given out. The clean up of the sites started in March 2010 with strict conditions being set by the Department of Environmental Affairs for the removal, transport and disposal of the medical waste.
