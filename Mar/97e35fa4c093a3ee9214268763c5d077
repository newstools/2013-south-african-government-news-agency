Pretoria - Former Member of Parliament Ishmael Vadi resumed his duties as new Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport after being sworn in on Wednesday. Vadi joins three other new MECs in the province who were sworn in their respective portfolios by Premier Nomvula Mokonyane last week. He had to vacate his seat in the National Assembly following the appointment. Vadi was the only MEC who was not sworn in as he was out of the country. He replaced Bheki Nkosi, who now heads the Infrastructure Development portfolio. In the reshuffle, ANC Youth League Gauteng chairperson Lebogang Maile became MEC for Sports with Humphrey Mmemezi occupying Local Government and Housing. Mokonyane also appointed former Ekurhuleni Mayor Ntombi Mekgwe as MEC for Health and Social Development, replacing Qedani Mahlangu. The new MECs are expected to meet with their heads of department before publicly unveiling their plans.
