Johannesburg - Jubilant soccer fans have already started to take their seats at the Ellis Park stadium ahead of the 4pm kick-off to the FIFA Confederations Cup. The atmosphere is electric with soccer fans blowing their vuvuzela and wearing Bafana Bafana jerseys. Among those dignities that have already arrived are businessman Patrice Motsepe and Jomo Cosmos owner Jomo Sono. President Jacob Zuma and other delegates are expected to arrive soon. It not clear whether former president Nelson Mandela will attend the game but an invitation was extended to him. President Jacob Zuma indicated on Saturday, that due to his age Madiba might not go to the stadium personally but his prayers and good wishes were with the team. About 62 000 soccer fanatics will gather to witness the opening match. There is also a heavy police contingency around the vicinity of the stadium, with police already patrolling the streets with their horses. Speaking to BuaNews before the kick-off, Brazilian football analyst, Deric Fulke said South Africa should have a good game against Iraq but its not going to come easy. "Its not going to be easy, but I think the fact that South Africa is playing at home is going to count in their favour. "Iraq is not a very well known team when it comes to football but I trust Bafana Bafana will give them a difficult game," said Mr Fulke.
