Polokwane - Limpopo's development arm, Trade and Investment Limpopo (TIL) and the South African-Netherlands Chamber of Commerce (SANEC) are expected to sign a service level agreement on Thursday to increase bilateral trade. Under the agreement, SANEC will organise trade and investment missions to Limpopo at least once a year, allowing TIL to arrange business networking opportunities, particularly in the agro-processing, tourism and technology sectors. "This is a huge victory for the province since SANEC will introduce TIL and its Limpopo stakeholders to potential investors and business partners from the Netherlands," said acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at TIL, Julius Mapatha. SANEC will also be expected to create a Limpopo investment desk in the Netherlands to promote specific trade and investment projects. "SANEC will forward trade inquiries from Dutch companies interested in specific TIL products of services," said Mr Mapatha. TIL and SANEC have been working together since 2007 after being introduced by South Africa's Department of Trade and Industry, said TIL spokesperson Kgomotso Molobi. Last year, the relationship led to the establishment and launch of a water purification project in Phalaborwa. The Dutch government donated R12 million to the project and has committed a further R3 million to expand it.
