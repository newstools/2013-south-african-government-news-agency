Pretoria - In supporting Car-Free Day, Gauteng Transport MEC Bheki Nkosi, will be using a public transport from Pretoria to Johannesburg. Car-Free Day is marked on 20 October and is one of the highlights of Transport Month. It encourages commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. Nkosi hopes that by using public transport he will encourage citizens to use public transport. Campaigns as Transport Month and Car-Free Day are meant to help find a better transport solution for Gauteng through a reduction of car dependence and the promotion of public transport systems. Car-Free Day also seeks to promote the improvement of mass transit modes, cycling and walking as well as the development of communities and settlements where jobs are closer to home and shopping is within distance. It brings together organizations and individuals dedicated to promoting alternatives to car-dependence and automobile-based planning and working to reduce the human impact on the natural environment while improving the quality of life for all.
