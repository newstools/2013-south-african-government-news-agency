Port Elizabeth - A total of 83 graduates, who have successfully completed their studies in social forestry, agri-business, crop and animal production at Fort Cox College in Port Elizabeth, will receive their qualifications on Friday. Eastern Cape Department of Agriculture media liaison officer, Thozi Manyisana, said the training of youth in agriculture formed part of the department's efforts to increase the number of skilled farmers in the province. He said in order to achieve this, Agricultural Colleges in the province have been set up to provide the youth with the training aimed at enhancing the capacitating of historically disadvantaged farmers. "Our commitment to revive agricultural colleges has created a human resource and institution capacitating division that deals with training, encouraging the youngsters to take agricultural careers and ensuring that agricultural colleges become fully functional," he said. Former Agriculture MEC Gugile Nkwinti said during his last visit to the college that the institution should continue producing good agriculture experts. According to Mr Manyisana, 13 of the graduates will receive qualifications in social forestry, eight in agri-business, 19 for crop production and 43 for animal production.
