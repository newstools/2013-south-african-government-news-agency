Cape Town - Authorities in Cape Town have arrested hundreds and fined more than 14 000 people for traffic law violations since the start of December. A total of 86 people were arrested by the metro police for driving under the influence of alcohol, 4948 were arrested and fined for driving without a licence, 3727 for unlicensed motor vehicles, 5404 for other traffic violations and 243 for by-law contraventions. This is according to the city's Metropolitan Police communication officer, Nosiseko Samuel who said the arrests where increased by the introduction of technologically innovative Segway Personal Transport two-wheelers and the Morph-Touch fingerprint scanning device. A least ten people were arrested at road blocks and vehicle check points using the sophisticated Morph Touch device, which compares the fingerprints of a suspect with a database containing the fingerprints of people who have outstanding warrants of arrest against them. It also stores other information such as vehicle registration numbers, firearm serial numbers and identity numbers The Segway Personal Transport two-wheelers, which can reach 20 kilometres per hour and are powered by batteries and controlled by computers and gyroscopes, were loaned to city's law enforcement departments by the company in order to enhance their patrol work. Through operations with the Segways, three people were arrested for riotous behaviour and another three for a smash-and-grab attempt. "They have been very useful in raising the profile and the mobility of the Metro Police in Sea Point and Camps Bay," said Ms Samuel. She said despite the holiday peak season coming to an end the metro police will continue to maintain a high-visibility presence with routine road blocks and patrols.
