Pretoria - President Jacob Zuma will on Sunday join hundreds of people at a cleansing and healing ceremony in Taylor's Halt, Pietermaritzburg. The Presidency said the event is aimed at thanking the community for working together to promote peace and unity, and encourage them to continue working together with government, to promote much-needed socio-economic development. The greater Pietermaritzburg area was engulfed by devastating conflict during the 1980s and early 1990s which claimed hundreds of lives and left thousands of families displaced and emotionally scarred. Zuma will be accompanied by among others, the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane. The President has just returned from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania where he attended the inauguration of that country's President Jakaya Kikwete. Kikwete has been returned to office following last weekend's elections. Reports say he won just over 61 percent of the votes, beating candidates from opposition parties.
