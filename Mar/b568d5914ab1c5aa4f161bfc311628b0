Pretoria - An Mpumalanga teacher and two learners have appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrates Court on allegations of leaking and being in possession of matric examination papers. Milton Msimango, 32, who is a teacher at Trinity College and learner Patience Mkhantshwa, 22, were arrested on Tuesday after being found in possession of the Mathematics Paper 1 and 2, Physical Science Paper 1 and 2 as well as an Accounting Paper. The second learner, Charity Xulu, 23, was arrested on Wednesday after also being found in a possession of the papers. They were all arrested inside the school premises. During their court appearance on Thursday, the suspects were not asked to plead and the case was postponed to 13 November 2009. Msimango was granted R3000 bail, while Mkhantshwa and Xulu were granted R1000 bail. Spokesperson for Mpumalanga Department of Education, Jasper Zwane commended the swift manner in which the police handled the matter. "This is a clear indication that the department is on top of the situation and ready to ensure that nothing jeopardizes the smooth running of the 2009 examination," Zwane said. He said the department was following up on a tip-off of another student and a teacher who had also apparently been found with examination material that was not supposed to be in their possession. Investigations are ongoing to verify the type of material, the spread and if it can be linked to the coming examinations, Zwane said. The examinations will commence on the 26 October 2009 and end on 4 December 2009.
