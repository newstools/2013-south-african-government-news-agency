Nelspruit - Mpumalanga's new Premier, David "DD" Mabuza, has promised a new level of service delivery in the province. "History has imposed on our shoulders the mandate to lead our people, whether black or white. I promise that I will give it my best," said Mr Mabuza. He said it was effective service delivery that the people deserved, after fighting as young men and women against apartheid rule. Mr Mabuza was elected Premier on Wednesday in a ceremony presided over by Deputy Judge President Phineas Mojapelo. The new legislature also elected Jackson Mthembu as Speaker and Violet Siwelaas his Deputy. Mr Mojapelo described it as a translation of the will of the people. "We are witnessing the swearing in of men and women who will keep the torch burning for the people of this province." He urged the members of the provincial legislature to serve with integrity. "We have to ensure that our people benefit from the work that is being done here today," he said, adding that he had grown up in Mpumalanga himself. Ms Siwela said she was confident of the new government and the fact that it would be able to perform. Mr Mabuza will be formally inaugurated on Monday at the KaNyamzane Stadium, outside Nelspruit.
