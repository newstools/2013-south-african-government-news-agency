Pretoria - Incoming Arts and Culture Minister Paul Mashatile will this evening be sworn into office following his appointment on Sunday. Mashatile was not sworn in on Monday at a ceremony conducted for other ministers, as he first had to be sworn in as a Member of Parliament. He replaces Lulu Xingwana who has now moved to the portfolio of Women, Children and People with Disabilities. He is a former Premier of Gauteng and has served on various leadership positions, including being an MEC for two consecutive terms.
