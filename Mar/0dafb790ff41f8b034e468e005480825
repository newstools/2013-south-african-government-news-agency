Pretoria - The 1 200 Gauteng teachers and support staff who did not get their April salary will receive the money in their bank accounts on Monday, said Premier Nomvula Mokonyane. "After receiving reports on the matter, MEC Barbara Creecy has intervened in the situation and last night the salaries of 1 060 staff members were processed through the system. "Employees will receive money in their bank accounts on Monday 18 May 2009," the Premier told the media on Thursday. The details of 140 further staff members, which had been incorrectly captured on the department's system, was being remedied on a case-by-case basis. "At present, 150 school liaison officers are phoning every school in the province to make sure no one else has slipped through the system," explained Ms Mokonyane. The new premier attributed the mistake to schools failing to extend the contracts of temporary staff. Newly appointed staff were also not entered into the central salary database, which resulted in them not being paid. Those staff who were not paid were either on temporary contracts or newly appointed. She said she had instructed the department to review the documentation flow from school to head office level to make sure information was received and processed timeously and to avoid the same mistake in the future
