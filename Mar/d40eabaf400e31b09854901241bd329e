East London - Human Settlements Minister Tokyo Sexwale says government will spend R300 million rectifying poorly-built RDP houses in the Eastern Cape. Mr Sexwale on Saturday visited Sweetwaters, Reeston and Duncan Village near East London to inspect RDP houses and engage the local communities. Accompanied by his deputy Zoliswa Kota-Fredericks, Mr Sexwale said it was important to upgrade those houses which were in a poor condition. "We cannot turn our backs on those houses because our mothers and fathers are moving to those houses. We are going to repair them," he said. The minister added that government was paying a high price for shoddy workmanship by inexperienced contractors and fly-by-night builders. The community told Mr Sexwale that they were concerned about the cracks which had started to appear in some of the houses which had been handed over to beneficiaries as well as vandalism. Provincial MEC, Nombulelo Mabandla, said the department would investigate blacklisting those contractors who did not complete houses properly to stop it from happening again.
