Johannesburg - The Chief Executive Officer of Helen Joseph Hospital in Johannesburg has been suspended pending an investigation into the death of a patient, allegedly while waiting for treatment. The Gauteng Health Department said on Wednesday Gladys Bogoshi had been withdrawn from the hospital with immediate effect pending an investigation into the death of Thabile Mlotshwe. The 30-year-old apparently died on Friday in the hospital while waiting for four hours for treatment. Mlotshwe arrived at the hospital's accident and emergency unit complaining that she had been vomiting blood the night before. The nurses referred her to the polyclinic where she waited for nearly four hours as her condition deteriorated. She started vomiting blood again at the polyclinic and was taken back to the casualty unit where she collapsed and died before doctors could treat her. The department's Chief of Operations, Dr Abul Rahman, said Bogoshi was withdrawn from the hospital to allow for an investigation to take place without hindrance. "The investigation into the incident will be completed by next week Tuesday and should the investigation reveal act of negligence, severe appropriate action would be taken," Dr Rahman warned. Dr Rahman, who described the incident as unfortunate, said the department could not allow a situation where patients' lives were being compromised.
