Durban - Within three days of becoming officially operational, the Hawks, have swooped on their first prey. The Hawks, or Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, arrested three men outside a jewellery store in Grey Street, Durban. It was believed they were about to commit a robbery. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Superintendent Vincent Mdunge, said the new crime-fighting unit had received intelligence that a robbery was about to be committed and dispatched a team to observe the location. The suspected robbers were apparently led by a sangoma who had used muti to ensure they could commit the crime safely. They were spotted in a car and confronted by the policemen before being arrested. Superintendent Mdunge said a firearm was recovered and the car would be screened to check if it was stolen. Police are also trying to link the suspects to other crimes committed in the Durban area. The Hawks were launched on Monday, officially replacing the Directorate of Special Operations (DSO), also known as Scorpions. They are tasked to prevent, combat and investigate national priority offences such as organized crime, corruption, and economic crimes. In February, former President Kgalema Motlanthe signed the South African Police Service (SAPS) Amendment Act and Section 43 of the National Prosecuting Authority Amendment Act. The two Acts provide for the transfer of the investigative capacity from the now dissolved DSO to the SAPS.
