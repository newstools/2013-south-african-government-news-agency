Johannesburg - Labour Minister Membathisi Mdladlana is hopeful that a solution to the wage dispute which has halted construction work at 2010 FIFA World Cup stadia will be found soon. The workers downed tools on Wednesday after the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) rejected the 10.4 percent wage increase offer made by the South African Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors (Safcec). The union is holding out for a 13 percent increase. Speaking exclusively to BuaNews on Thursday Minister Mdladlana said the meeting, currently taking place between NUM, Safcec and the 2010 Local Organising Committee, was aimed at finding a lasting solution to the strike. "We have to find a solution in this matter which will benefit both parties, it is in the interest of the nation. This World Cup is important to all of us and having such disputes will paint a bad to picture to the country. "The two organisations have shown a great commitment and hopefully we will find a settlement on this matter before the end of today," he said. LOC Chairperson, Irvin Khoza said it was important that he had received a memorandum from the workers at Soccer City Stadium. "We will take their grievances seriously, I do not think we can fail. I have appealed to both parties to make peace and find an advantageous settlement. These projects are the core for the country to deliver a successful world cup," Dr Khoza told BuaNews. He said the Guatrain projects, construction of roads and other 2010 related projects needed to be completed in due time, and that the workers and employers were key to the successful fulfillment of FIFA guarantees towards hosting the event. Business Unity South Africa Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Professor Raymond Parsons, told BuaNews that there must be commitment from both parties to find a lasting solution. The two organisations are expected to announce the outcome of the meeting later today. -
