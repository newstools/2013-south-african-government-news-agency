Pretoria - Department of Labour inspectors will this week conduct inspections at shopping malls, targeting mainly restaurants. The inspections, which will take place in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, will ensure compliance with labour legislation by employers. "The planned inspections are triggered by the possible exploitation of workers in this sector, as well as the possible existence of other irregularities relating to hours of work, payment for overtime and the maintenance of machinery used in restaurants," said the department's spokesperson Page Boikanyo. According to the department, possible exploitation of foreign nationals who may not be registered with the Unemployment Insurance Fund will also form part of the exercise.
