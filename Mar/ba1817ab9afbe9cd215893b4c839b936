Johannesburg - The Johannesburg Metro Police have warned football fans making their way to the Ellis Park stadium for the first game of the 2009 FIFA Confederations that the park and ride facilities at the stadium are full. "The park and ride facility is full and people should use the facilities at the Dome at Northgate, Nasrec or Bez Park as no cars more would be allowed in," Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said. He was speaking to BuaNews shortly before the opening ceremony got underway. Supporters who park at these facilities will then make use of the iTransie 2 Ellis Park! and GauRide services to get to the stadium. The N2 highway and Joe Slovo Drive at Abel Street have been blocked off for the Confederations Cup and motorists travelling with cars from the South have been urged to use Klein Street and those travelling from North should rather use Twist Street. Regarding security measure put in place at the stadium, Chief Superintendent Minnaar said hundreds of metro officers have been deployed at the stadium. "We have a good plan regarding security and traffic, we've been working together with the South African Police Services (SAPS)," he said. National Police Spokesperson Director Sally de Beer told BuaNews that over 5 000 police officers have been deployed inside and outside the Ellis Park Stadium to ensure that there is no trouble. "The security is very tight, our members are trained very well in crime controlling and we are not expecting any trouble during the match," Ms de Beer said. The first 2009 Confederations Cup match between Bafana Bafana and Iraq is expected to start at 4pm, the opening ceremony started at 2pm.
