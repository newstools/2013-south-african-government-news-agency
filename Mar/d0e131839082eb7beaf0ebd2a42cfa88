Pretoria - Correctional Services Deputy Commissioner of Government Information Technology (GITO), Jack Shilubane, has been placed on precautionary suspension, the department confirmed on Wednesday. Shilubane's suspension follows concerns raised by the Auditor-General regarding the state of Information Technology, procurement and possible contravention of the Public Finance Management Act. In a statement, the department said: "The constitutional presumption of innocence is upheld and the precautionary suspension is instituted to give the investigation commissioned by the National Commissioner space." Meanwhile, the University of Free State (UFS) has refuted media reports that it has suspended its Vice-Rector of External Relations, Prof Ezekiel Moraka. "The Management of UFS hereby confirms that Prof. Ezekiel Moraka... has not been suspended, as was reported in some of the media since last night." UFS spokesperson Lacea Loader said management communicated with Moraka about its intention to suspend him, based on allegations of misconduct. Loader said Moraka has requested five days to submit reasons he should not be suspended. "As a result, the UFS has granted this request and has placed Prof. Moraka on special leave in order for him to prepare his submission. "A final decision regarding the suspension will only be made once the UFS has considered Prof Moraka's submission. The UFS confirms that the due process of the law is adhered to in all labour processes," she said.
