Pretoria - The heavens have opened and a heavy rain is falling over Pretoria, where the capital stands ready to inaugurate its new President. Light bellows of thunder and some flashes of lightening have signaled a storm. Weather forecasters had warned of an impending rain for today and revelers who are streaming in to the lawns to witness the grand event, had prepared well for the weather. They have come dressed in thick jackets, dry macs and carrying blankets and umbrellas. And for the invited guests, big black umbrellas have been provided to keep them dry during the prestigious proceedings. But, even the weather has not dampened the spirits of the crowds that are gathering - they are still jubilantly singing - welcoming the weather as a blessing.
