Pretoria - Deputy Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs Rejoice Mabudafhasi will officially launch the 2005 State of the Air Report on Monday. The purpose of the report is to give an overview of the state of air quality in South Africa, as well as to provide a baseline on the levels of air pollution in the country. The launch will take place during the opening session of the 4th Annual Air Quality Governance Lekgotla which is convened by the Department of Water and Environmental Affairs. The annual lekgotla intends to impart knowledge to government air quality managers and inspire them to strengthen and fine tune their emission licensing capacity with a view to ensuring efficient and effective delivery of Atmospheric Emission Licensing services. With the final repeal of the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act, 1965 (Act No. 45 of 1995) in 2009/10 financial year, a significant milestone in the history of air quality governance in South Africa has been reached. "To this end, the implementation of the industrial emission authorisation regime has been passed from the national department to metropolitan and district municipalities and provinces. "In this regard, it is expected that the new Licensing Authorities will, in the short-term, at least be providing the same, or a better service, as that provided by the National Department from 1965 and, in the medium- to long-term, will provide a far better service, in line with the provisions of the Constitution," the department said. The 2009 Annual Air Quality Governance Lekgotla aims to initiate and concretize this move from good to great in the delivery of Atmospheric Emission Licensing services.
