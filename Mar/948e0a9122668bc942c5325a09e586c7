East London - The Eastern Cape Housing Department will on Friday hand over houses to five farm workers and shack dwellers working and living on the Tarkastad. Premier Noxolo Kiwiet and department MEC Nombulelo Mabandla will hand over the 40 square meter houses, which have two bedrooms, a toilet, a living room and a kitchen. On the same day, the department will also launch a consumer housing education truck, which forms part of the Housing on Wheels pilot project. "The truck will raise public awareness on the housing programme, products and services in various areas of the province," said department spokesperson, Lwandile Sicwetsha. Beneficiaries will also be updated on progress relating to their application for houses while municipalities will be able to access information to check status on housing projects and approval of projects. The truck is expected to visit areas like the Nelson Mandela Metro, Ukhahlamba, Cacadu, OR Tambo, Alfred Nzo, Chris Hani, Makana and Amathole municipalities.
