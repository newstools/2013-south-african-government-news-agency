Johannesburg - Veteran journalist, Debora Patta, has resigned as Editor-in-Chief at the e-News Channel, the e.tv broadcaster has announced. According to e.tv, Patta has decided to focus solely on her investigative journalism programme 3rd Degree. Patta took over as e-News Channel chief in 2005 while also hosting and producing 3rd Degree. "This has been a very difficult decision, but I believe it is right for me to follow my passion for journalism. Given the pressures of producing an investigative programme and the demanding job as Editor-in-Chief, it would have become unsustainable to do both in the long run," said Patta. She said that in the end, her decision had been based on her passion for journalism and certainty that there were still many untold stories in South Africa. e.tv Chief Executive Officer Marcel Golding said Patta's resignation came as a "great regret". Patrick Conroy, the current Group News Editor will take over from Patta.
