Nelson Mandela Bay - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has assured the local community that their tap water is safe to drink. "We would like to assure the residents of Nelson Mandela Bay that their water supply is safe to drink," said Councillor Mtutuzeli Tokota, Standing Committee Chairperson of Infrastructure, Engineering, Electricity and Energy. This follows the municipality receiving a Blue Drop Score of 85 percent and 99 percent for drinking water quality compliance by the Department of Water and Environmental Affairs on Tuesday. The Blue Drop Report was released in Tuesday at the Drinking Water Quality Conference in Port Elizabeth which was attended by the newly appointed Minister of Environment and Water Affairs Buyelwa Sonjica. The main reason for not achieving the 97 percent minimum compliance for the Blue Drop Certification was as a result of some of its standard operating procedures going undocumented in a format prescribed by the department. The municipality has recently experienced challenges at the Rocklands Water Treatment Works. However, according to a statement by the municipality, the high levels of aluminium that were previously experienced in the water supply as well as the levels of trihalomethanes have been addressed. "We are committed to ensure that the status quo remains and we will strive to achieve even higher consistency levels," said Councilor Tokota.
