Polokwane - George Muthundinne Phadagi, the former mayor of the then Thohoyandou Transitional Local Council (TLC), has been appointed as the new MEC for Public Works in Limpopo. The appointment follows the death of the former MEC, Pandelani "Sparks" Ramagoma, who died in a car accident a week ago between Makhado and Polokwane. Mr Phadagi, a former Member of Parliament, was appointed by Limpopo Premier Cassel Mathale on Thursday. Making the announcement, the Premier said he was confident that Mr Phadagi was the ideal person for the position and he was looking forward to working with him. "We are confident that in comrade Phadagi we have identified a cadre and a leader who has what it takes to equal the challenge of our day and time. We are looking forward to his immense contribution to our core mandate of building a better life for the people of our province. "We would also like to take this opportunity to wish him well in his new assignment," said Mr Mathale. Mr Phadagi played a pivotal role in bringing about freedom and democracy in South Africa during the apartheid era. He participated and led the Mass Democratic Movement in various capacities. The 1980s saw him play a major role in leading the United Democratic Front and the Northern Transvaal Action Committee among others. After the unbanning of the liberation movements by the former apartheid regime, he played a key role in the re-establishment and the re-launching of the African National Congress (ANC) structures in the country, especially in the far-north region. Mr Phadagi was the Chairperson of the ANC in the far-north region, known as the Vhembe district. He also served in the Provincial Executive Committee of the ANC in Limpopo. He was deployed as the mayor of the Thohoyandou TLC, now Thulamela Local Municipality from 1995 to 2000. From 2001 to 2009, Mr Phadagi served the people of South Africa as a Member of Parliament. Like his late predecessor, the new MEC also hail from the Vhembe district.
