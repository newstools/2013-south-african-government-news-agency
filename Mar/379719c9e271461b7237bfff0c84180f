Pretoria - Schools hit by recent storms in Limpopo will soon be able to continue with their exams as the provincial Education Department will be distributing about 111 mobile classrooms to the affected schools. Twenty-two provincial schools in the Sekhukhune, Waterberg, Vhembe, Mopani and Capricon districts were left without classrooms following hail storms, which also left hundreds of people homeless. Department spokesperson Ndo Mangala said that 130 classrooms were affected and an amount of about R28 million has been allocated towards the purchase of mobile classroom to be used as temporary relief. "The department has already contracted service providers to either relocate mobile classes where they are no longer needed or supply new ones to the affected schools," said Mangala, adding that the process had started on Thursday. He said the department had also commissioned its contracted professional infrastructure support team of engineers and architects to conduct condition assessment of all the affected schools and determine the costs of revamping and rebuilding the affected schools. "We will include all these schools in our 2011/12 financial year infrastructure budget for implementation," Mangala said.
