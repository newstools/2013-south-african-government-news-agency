Durban - Learners at the Sithabile Secondary School in Inanda had been battling for years to study in make-shift structures or "pozzi huts". However, the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education stepped in and spent R27.8 million to rebuild Sithabile Secondary School which accommodates 1216 learners. The school, which was established in 1992, now comprises of 28 classrooms, 12 boys toilets, 12 girls toilets, five toilets for educators and five toilets for disabled learners. MEC for Education, Ina Cronje said they had also built a media centre, a computer centre, two science laboratories as well as one administration block. "The school is 95 percent complete and the last final touches are being done," said Ms Cronje. Similar to Sithabile Secondary School, learners and educators of the Uthando Public Primary School had to make do with temporary structures, until they were able to move into their brand-new triple-storied school in 2008. The department initiated a renewal project worth R18.4 million. Twenty Four classrooms, 12 male toilets, 12 female toilets, two toilets for educators, one toilet for disabled learners, a media centre, computer laboratory, an administration block and a kitchen and dining area were built. The schools have been fully fenced and electrified and have piped water. "Going to school has dramatically changed for the learners, educators and the school community. Gone are the days of trying to learn in their school shacks, facing blistering heat, freezing cold and rain drops through leaking roofs," Ms Cronje said.
