Pretoria - The case involving two boys, who allegedly drugged and raped a school girl in Johannesburg, has been dismissed due to inadmissible evidence, says the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). NPA spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga on Tuesday told BuaNews: "We need to confirm that after carefully looking into the matter, we came to a decision that this matter cannot be placed on the court-roll due to insufficient evidence." However, Mhaga said they have since requested the police to continue with their comprehensive investigation. He said it would be at the end of the investigation where they would decide whether to reassess their decision or not. The two boys, who were arrested on Monday, are aged 14 and 16. Their arrest follows an incident last Thursday, where three boys allegedly drugged two girls and gang raped one of them on school premises, while filming it on their cellphones.
