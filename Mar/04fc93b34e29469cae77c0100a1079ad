Pretoria - Cabinet has expressed hope that a new Bafana Bafana coach is appointed soon, following the resignation of head coach Joel Santana. "Cabinet also expressed the hope that the soccer authorities will do their best to ensure that a new coach is appointed sooner rather than later to continue the process of preparing a competitive Bafana Bafana team for the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals," said Themba Maseko, government spokesperson. He was briefing the media on Thursday on Cabinet's ordinary meeting in Cape Town. Santana resigned from the national team on Monday, just eight months before the World Cup. He had come under severe criticism after a string of poor results by the national team. The South African Football Association (SAFA) Vice-President Mandla 'Shoes' Mazibuko said earlier this week that the association would move with speed to appoint a new coach for Bafana Bafana. SAFA's national executive is expected to meet on Friday to discuss Santana's replacement. Meanwhile, Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe is to launch the Football Friday initiative for government in support of the country's hosting of the World Cup. The launch will take place on the 30 October at the Union Buildings and will coincide with the meeting of the 2010 Inter-Ministerial Committee, according to Maseko.
