Pretoria - Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and communities in Gauteng will have an opportunity to get more information on how to access funding through government's Grant-in-Aid workshops. As from 24 October to 28 November 2009, the Department of Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation will be running Grant-in-Aid workshops throughout the local government regions of Gauteng. The funds are meant to assist NGOs and organised entities operating within the areas of sport and recreation, arts and culture and HIV and AIDS. MEC for Gauteng Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation, Nelisiwe Mbatha-Mthimkhulu said the workshops are aimed at informing communities about the grant-in-aid processes, the required documents and how to apply. The workshops will also assist stakeholders on how to write project proposals, how to draw up a budget and how to write financial statements, the MEC said. She further explained that the grants-in-aid are given out to assist in social and economic development projects thereby supporting community projects aimed at achieving development goals related to the department's vision. "Through these workshops, the department wants to ensure that more projects qualify for the grants and thereby receive funding for their work, which we know will assist us to achieve our mandate and vision," said Mbatha- Mthimkhulu. The workshops will be held in Westbury, Eldorado Park, Diepsloot, KwaThema and Thokoza.
