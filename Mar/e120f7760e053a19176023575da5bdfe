Pretoria - The Department of Labour is expected to kick off blitz inspections on companies in the construction sector, starting from today. According to department spokesperson Page Boikanyo, the five-day inspections will focus on companies' compliance with health and safety laws. "With construction booming, we have a duty to see to it that workers operate in safe conditions and eliminate unnecessary accidents in a proactive manner. "Our approach will be underpinned by pillars of education, monitoring and ensuring compliance with labour standards,'' said Mr Boikanyo. The worst offending employers would be followed up on and be subjected to prosecution, he said, adding that a database of repeat offending employers would be created. He said labour inspectors visiting various workplaces will be accompanied by senior departmental officials. The Free State province has been identified as one of the many places to be visited during this week. Mr Boikanyo said inspections in sectors like hospitality and private security will be conducted in November and February next year.
