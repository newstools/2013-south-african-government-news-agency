Polokwane - The Limpopo government and its people are still reeling in shock after the sudden death of the province's MEC for Public Works, Pandelani Ramagoma, 52. Mr Ramagoma died in a road accident on Monday morning, along the N1 road between Makhado and Polokwane. According to Police Superintendent Ronel Otto, Mr Ramagoma's driver was also killed when he lost control of the vehicle on his way to Polokwane. Mr Ramagoma was flung out of the car before it burst into flames. "The MEC was flung from the vehicle after the vehicle crashed into the barrier - it burst into flames. The driver was trapped in the vehicle and both died on the scene." She said police had opened a case of culpable homicide. Mr Ramagoma's untimely death came less than ten days after the Limpopo Department of Roads and Transport conducted a cleansing ceremony along the N1 road following the high spate of road accidents. From the border town of Musina, the N1 road was fast becoming known as the 'road of death' following the continuous spate of fatal and horrific accidents there. The Public Works MEC has been a member of the Limpopo Provincial Executive Council since 2006. Before he was appointed as senior general manager in the Premier's office as policy coordination in 2005, he worked as the accounting officer for the Provincial Local Government and Housing Department from 2000. He was also a member of the provincial executive committee of the African National Congress and he was currently chairperson of the Limpopo Provincial South African Communist Party.
