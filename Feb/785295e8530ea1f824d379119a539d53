Pretoria - A new hospital will be built in Free State Province to replace the current National Hospital said Free State Premier Ace Magashule. Magashule said approval and funding have been obtained from national government for the construction of a new hospital in Mangaung. "Having noted the extensive work and related resources that will be required to upgrade the current National Hospital to a modern high quality public health care institution, approval and funding have been obtained from the national government for the construction of a new hospital in Mangaung," Magashule said. Magashule said the upgrading of Pelonomi Hospital including the second phase of construction of both the Trompsburg and Ladybrand Hospitals will continue. He added that renovations at the Boitumelo Hospital will be fast-tracked. He added that more clinics will be built and the number of ambulances increased, especially in rural areas. He said: "The provincial government is currently considering new innovative financing models that will further address our priority requirements in terms of medical facilities and equipment. "To address the issue of shortage of doctors in the Phumelela area, we will deploy sufficient doctors for our people to have access to better healthcare services." Magashule added that the province will conduct two immunisation campaigns. The first of these campaigns will focus on measles, polio and the provision of Vitamin A as well as H1N1 vaccinations. The second campaign will focus on H1N1 vaccinations of vulnerable groups, and children under 15 who are HIV positive. The campaign will be conducted in schools throughout the province in April and May this year.
