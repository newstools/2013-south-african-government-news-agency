Pretoria - Honda SA has decided to conduct a safety recall of all 2002 to 2008 year model Jazz units in South Africa. The recall of the previous generation Jazz model is necessary to inspect and modify driver door power-window switches that may, in some cases, short circuit as a result of water intrusion into the housing. Following a tragic fire in September 2009 which resulted in the death of satirist Justin Nurse's two-year-old daughter Vanilla, Honda launched an extensive investigation to determine the cause of the incident. "Whilst the cause of the fire remains indeterminable, the investigation has shown that water intrusion into the power window switch housing may, in some instances cause a short circuit, which in exceptional circumstances, may lead to potential damages. "As a precautionary measure, Honda has decided to implement a safety recall of all 2002-2008 year model Jazz units in South Africa," said Honda. It said owners would be notified directly of the recall and a Honda dealer will inspect the driver door power window switch and if water intrusion is observed, the switch will be replaced. In all cases a counter measure to prevent any water intrusion will be fitted. Customers may contact Honda South Africa on 0800 HONDA1 or email care@honda.co.za.
