Pretoria - Jubilation and tears of joy as well as visible disappointment has marked the release of the 2009 matric results at Pretoria High School for Girls. Known for its sterling performance, the school managed to secure a 99.9 percent pass rate with only one learner having failed. Numerous learners gathered at the school this morning to receive the results of the final examinations. Liang Yu, 17, who is one of the top learners at the school, received eight distinctions including in Maths and Science. She attributed her achievement to hard work, dedication and support from her teachers. "I always told myself that if you work hard you can achieve anything. I always see challenges as opportunities rather than obstacles," said an excited Yu, who plans to study Biochemistry in the United States this year. Stephanie Marais, 17, plans to study towards a Degree in Education at the University of Pretoria. While disappointed at not having achieved the symbol she wanted, she is happy about her overall marks. "I am going to university that is what is important to me. The exams were very tough and tricky and I am very proud of myself." Gabrielle Simone, 17, who plans to study Information Design at the University of Pretoria, said: "I am shocked at the same time very excited, considering how difficult the maths paper was." An equally ecstatic school principal, Penny McNair, told BuaNews that while she was disappointed at the failure of one learner she was proud of her school's performance. She said the good results were due to the hard work and commitment of teachers. "They have been working very hard to get us where we are today. We owe this achievement to them," said McNair. Pretoria High School for Girls has been getting a 100 percent pass rate for the last five years.
