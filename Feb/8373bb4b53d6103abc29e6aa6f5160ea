Johannesburg - In what can only be described as a spectacular Opening Match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the hosts held a much stronger Mexican side to an enthralling 1-1 draw, and made the nation proud. Bafana Bafana sent South Africans into a cheer by scoring the first goal in the second half, only to have their hearts ripped out with an equalizer by the Mexicans with 10 minutes to go in the match. The first half saw the hosts outplayed by a much higher ranked Mexico, with them being kept away from the net by brilliant saves by goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune. The Bafana side started the second half with renewed vigour which saw them spend more time in their opponents half. A great break saw Siphiwe Tshabalala boot in an excellent goal that left Soccer City in jubilation. Bafana looked like they were on a mission and missed the back of the net several times to rob them of what would have been a historic victory. A draw may not be the best result but the boys in green and gold did the country proud and kept their World Cup hopes alive and kicking.
