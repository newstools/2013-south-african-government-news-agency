Durban - A theme song has been written ahead of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children, due to be launched in Cape Town next week. The song is entitled "Awuyeke" which means stop it in isiZulu. In the context of the campaign, the song is an appeal for violence to be stopped against children and women. Launched by the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Arts and Culture at an event at the weekend, Awuyeke is the department's contribution to the international campaign that runs annually during November and December. "It spreads the message that we have repeated over the years for all of us to act against the abuse of women and children. As a department we saw it important to do something significant as our contribution to this important campaign," said MEC for Arts, Culture, Sports and Recreation Weziwe Thusi. The department had approached Joe Nina, a renowned artist in the country, to record the song in collaboration with the Green Berets, a group of young men living with disabilities. The successful musician has been in the music industry for more than two decades and has worked with legendary musicians including Steve Kekana, Babsy Mlangeni, Nana Coyote and Madala Kunene. The department also hopes to highlight the role of people living with disabilities in fighting for social justice using music and other art forms as a medium. "We want to ensure that our people also understand that violence against women and children is indeed everybody's business because it affects all of us," the MEC said. Thusi hoped the tune will be played on radio stations so that the message of the song reaches everyone. The song is available on CD and the department's website and Facebook page.
