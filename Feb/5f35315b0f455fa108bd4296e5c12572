Polokwane - Several learners from both primary and high schools around Limpopo have been awarded certificates of appreciation for their efforts in helping police to curb crime over the festive season. Wearing T-shirts with the slogan "Polokwane Youth Against Crime", the learners helped police to patrol shopping malls, taxi ranks, taverns and even participated in stop and search operations in the townships. "The patrol was set up in groups of 15 children accompanied by a police member, who was there to protect them because they were not carrying any weapons," said Polokwane Police Station spokesperson Captain Mohlaka Mashiane on Tuesday. He said the learners were given lessons in peer education, to encourage other children not to get involved in crime and drugs. Addressing the learners at the awards ceremony in Polokwane on Monday, the police's provincial youth coordinator, Captain Thobya Mothobuka, referred to the youth as ambassadors and champions of the province. "It takes a crime-free mind to fight crime. Your contribution to your community safety is noted with huge respect and for that we would like to applaud and salute you," she said. Mothobuka urged the youth to be more involved in fighting crime at their areas. "I believe by involving the youth in fighting crime, the country will be free," she said. Youth representative, Khomotso Mothobuka, promised that he and his fellow crime busters would continue to help the police. "We declare to police today that our services are available at any time at no cost and we are willing to help them fighting crime together," said Khomotso. Mashiane said the project would be implemented again this year.
