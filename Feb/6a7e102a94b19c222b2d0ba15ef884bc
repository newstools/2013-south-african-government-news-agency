Pretoria - Traffic in Pretoria was brought to a standstill on Thursday when members of the South African Navy marched through the streets in support of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign. Clad in their crisp, white uniforms, the members of the Navy marched from Church Square through to the Naval Mess in Arcadia, causing a stir among the city's motorists, pedestrians and employees working in the surrounding buildings. The men and women in white held the march to convey the message that women's rights are human rights and violence against women and children constitutes a violation of human rights. "We call upon men especially to eradicate all forms of oppressive, exploitative and abusive tendencies that undermines the rights of women and children," they said. The 16 Days of Activism campaign is a United Nations-endorsed initiative and therefore a global campaign seeking to raise global consciousness on the epidemic of gender and child violence besetting society. It was officially launched in Johannesburg on Wednesday. While the campaign runs from 25 November to 10 December every year, its objectives are reinforced by the year-long 365 Days Programme and a National Plan. The Navy members also called on members of the public to support people living with HIV and AIDS by commemorating the World Aids Day on 1 December and to remember those who are infected and affected by the disease.
