Nelspruit - Leaders from the Mpumalanga Government, municipalities and other state institutions across the province are expected to sign a pledge to produce clean audit reports by 2014. The Mpumalanga government will launch its own provincial Operation Clean Audit 2014 on Tuesday. "At least 60 percent of the municipalities, provincial departments and (other state) entities must achieve unqualified audit opinions by 2012 ... and all (must) achieve unqualified audit opinions by 2014," said Mabutho Sithole, spokesperson for provincial premier David Mabuza. Operation Clean Audit was launched nationally by Minister of Co-Operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Sicelo Shiceka in June. The national campaign seeks to ensure that by 2014 all 283 municipalities and all provincial departments in South Africa's nine provinces produce clean audit reports and implement systems that will sustain the production of quality financial statements and management information. In Mpumalanga, only 10 of the 21 municipalities received clean audit records for the 2007/08 financial year. Although low, the results were an improvement when compared to the previous year when only five municipalities received clean audits. Between 2010 and 2011 no municipality, provincial department or other state entity is allowed to receive adverse audit opinions or disclaimers. Sithole said Operation Clean Audit will also address all issues raised by the Auditor-General and reduce the vulnerability to risks in the municipalities, provincial departments and entities audit reports through targeted projects. Provincial Operation Clean Audit 2014 will be signed at the Mbombela Local Municipality in Nelspruit on Tuesday morning. All MECs, mayors and CEOs of state entities are expected to attend the event.
