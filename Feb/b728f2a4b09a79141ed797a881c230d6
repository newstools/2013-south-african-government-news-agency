Pretoria - Anxious Grade 1's and their worried parents are to receive a word of encouragement from Free State Premier Ace Magashule and Education MEC Kate Makgoe when they start their first day of school tomorrow. Magashule and Makgoe will visit various schools in the province tomorrow, as schools across the country reopen. The visits are also aimed at ensuring the 2010 academic year kicks off smoothly and that any hiccups which may arise are dealt with swiftly. According to spokesperson for the provincial education department, Howard Ndaba, textbooks have been delivered to all schools in the province and teachers are prepared and ready to begin the year. Ndaba told BuaNews that although they were done with the registration of learners, they expected some late comers tomorrow and they would therefore continue with registrations to accommodate all the learners. While the province achieved a 69.4 pass rate, a decline of 2.4 percent, Ndaba said the department was determined to ensure the province achieved a 75 percent matric pass for this year. Nationally, the matric pass rate is 60.6 percent.
