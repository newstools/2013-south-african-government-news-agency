Pretoria - Government's anti-poverty programme will see Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe on a visit to several community projects in the Eastern Cape this week. Motlanthe will assess the progress that has been made in the province, after the campaign was introduced there in 2008. At that time, a number of commitments were made to communities and households. At Lubala Village near Mthatha on Friday, Motlanthe will conduct door- to- door campaigns and visits to community-based projects aimed at alleviating poverty. The War on Poverty Campaign was commissioned by the Presidency with former Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka as its champion. It is a nationwide on-going government campaign which seeks to reduce poverty among the country's poor.
