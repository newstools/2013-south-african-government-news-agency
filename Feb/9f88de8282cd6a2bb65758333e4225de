Pretoria - President Jacob Zuma will on Thursday brief the media on the report of the Nhlapo Commission on traditional leadership disputes and claims, according to the Presidency. The commission was appointed by former President Thabo Mbeki in 2003 to investigate traditional leadership disputes and claims dating back to 1927. Chaired by Professor Thandabantu Nhlapo, the commission held hearings into legitimacy of tribes and claims for traditional leadership across the country. Several tribal authorities had applied to the commission to either have their chieftaincy enlarged or have new kings and chiefs recognised. Tensions erupted in some provinces when the commission recommended that some kingships be recognised and others stripped of their status. But its recommendations were never implemented as Zuma undertook to review them before making any announcement. Government has also announced that the much anticipated Traditional Courts Bill will be passed by the national Parliament before the end of the year. The Bill aims at affirming the recognition of the traditional justice system and its values while promoting social cohesion among traditional authorities.
