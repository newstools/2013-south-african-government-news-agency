Taung - North West Premier Maureen Modiselle has assured learners and teachers that she would everything possible to remedy the situation at the school she found without a principal and a deputy. Modiselle said it was unacceptable that Mokgareng High School in Taung had no managerial capacity which, she said, contributed to the low morale among learners. Out of a total of 400 students only 258 learners reported to school this morning. Modiselle urged the teachers to fervently engage learners to start working hard and appealed to all education stakeholders to support them throughout the year. Two Grade 12 learners, Kelebogile Mongwegape, 20, and Pretty Qobolo, 18, said irrespective of the failure rate at their school, they were determined to pass with flying colours. "We will be the first to change the situation here; we are going to start our studies today and nothing will stop us," they said. Lack of resources is also a major problem facing the school. The school does not have a library, science laboratory, administration offices and sports grounds.
