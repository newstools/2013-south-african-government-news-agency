Pretoria - The arrest of suspects wanted in connection with the murder of a businesswoman and her family demonstrates the police's resolve to turn the tide against crime, says North West public safety MEC Howard Yawa. Police found the bodies of businesswoman Maria Khoza, her two teenage sons, nephew as well as a 46-year-old relative, Daniel Karfhia lying in a pool of blood at her home in Vula Section, Lethabong on Sunday. Neighbours called the police when they spotted pools of blood in Khoza's garage. Khoza owned a supermarket, butchery and liquor store in the area. Police suspect that the four were strangled while Karfhia was shot dead. A total of five suspects have been arrested in connection with the murders while two of them have been linked positively to the crime through fingerprints found in a Nissan Navara bakkie and on electrical appliances allegedly stolen from Khoza. Lesiba Kgwele, a spokesperson of the North West public safety department, said the five suspects will appear in the Rustenburg Magistrate's court on Tuesday. Yawa has commended the police on the swift arrests and conveyed his condolences to the Khoza and Karfhia families.
