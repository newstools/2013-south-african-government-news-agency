Pretoria - Social Development Minister Edna Molewa is expected to announce the outcome of an investigation into South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) Chief Executive Officer, Fezile Makiwane soon. The minister and Makiwane had in July mutually agreed that he should go on special leave pending a probe by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) into the alleged misuse of funds managed by pay point service providers at SASSA. The SIU further investigated the alleged flouting of the rules pertaining to the Public Finance Management Act and irregular procurement processes by Makiwane in his capacity as the CEO of SASSA. Molewa has since received the report by the SIU and on Monday gave it to Makiwane to allow him an opportunity to respond to the findings, as required by law. "He has until the 18 December to respond, after which I will study his response and announce my decision to the public," Molewa said. Coceko Pakade, the Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Social Development, has been acting as SASSA's CEO in Makiwane's absence to ensure the continuation of service delivery.
