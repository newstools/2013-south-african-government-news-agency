Pretoria - About 10 community health centres in Gauteng will be operating on a 24-hour basis during the 2010/2011 financial year. "As from April the department will extend hours of service in 20 of the provincial's 34 community health centres," said Gauteng Health and Social Development MEC Qedani Mahlangu on Tuesday. She said the extended hours would help to improve access to health services for people, including visitors, during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. From April, the health centres, Lillian Ngoyi, KwaThema, Phillip Moyo, Ramokonopi, Mohlakeng, Bekkersdal West, Khutsong, Thusanang, Eersterus and Johann Heyns will be operating on a 24-hour basis. Vosloorus Poly Clinic, Kathlehong North, Thembisa Main, Thembisa Health Care Clinic, Khutsong East, Khutsong Ext 3, Yarona, Odoroleng, Dr Ramirez Martinez and Simunye Clinic East will also increase their hours of service from eight to 12 hours, five days a week. In an effort to build an effective health system, ambulances will be stationed at clinics and hospitals rather than far-away depots to enable quick responses to emergencies and improve communication with accident and trauma units. Mahlangu said the department will also strengthen partnerships with the private sector to extend services to more communities. "We are grateful to all partners who have supported us this year and those who have indicated a willingness to help in the future. Through this support, we will be able to build new clinics in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, and Finetown in the south in the 2010/2011 financial year," said Mahlangu.
