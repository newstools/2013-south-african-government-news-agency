Nelspruit- The Mpumalanga Council of Churches (MCC) has urged all churches in the province to encourage their members to test for HIV. This follows on government's announcement of the country's biggest ever HIV and Aids campaign, which aims to test up to 15 million people by June 2011. The ecumenical secretary of the MCC, Reverend Luke Dlamini, said it was time that churches took a visible stand in the fight against the spread of HIV. "As leaders of churches and as Christians we need to know our HIV status. We have chosen this day as the day for all our members to go for testing," Dlamini said, adding that church leaders should also know their status. "You cannot tell others to condomise or to go for an HIV test when you don't know your own status. It's unprofessional." Dlamini said the MCC and provincial church organisations had to put a concerted effort into organising tests and counselling for church members. "We cannot sit and relax while the spread of HIV continues to affect our communities. Campaigns like these should form part of an ongoing process to fight the disease. I hope every South African citizen will take part and go for an HIV test," he said.
