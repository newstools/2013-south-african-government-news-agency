Pretoria - Traffic on the N1 between Johannesburg and Pretoria, one of Gauteng's busiest highways, was brought to a standstill this morning with reported delays of up to two hours. The delays were caused after an accident involving seven cars, between Allendale and New Road traveling south. While no one was injured in the incident, the road remained closed to traffic for several hours, according to Superintendent Wayne Minnaar. Traffic coming into Pretoria was also held up by an accident involving two cars on Potgieter Road. At least three people were seriously injured. "They were all rushed to hospital after obtaining some serious injuries," said Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson Console Tleane. Meanwhile, authorities in Ekurhuleni on the East Rand also had their hands full trying to rescue flood victims on Wednesday night. Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality spokesperson Zweli Dlamini confirmed that around 300 families in Palmridge were to be relocated to tents on Thursday morning after their homes were flooded. This follows days of torrential rain in the province. Dlamini said the municipality was providing the affected families with blankets and food parcels so they can be able to sustain themselves while a permanent solution was being sought. -
