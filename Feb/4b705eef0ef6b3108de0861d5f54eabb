Limpopo- Limpopo is ready to host the millions of local and international soccer fans that will descend on South Africa's shores come June 11, says provincial spokesperson, Phuti Mosomane. "We are sending our message to the fans out there that Limpopo is awaiting them. We promise to render excellent services to them, from security to pleasure. We want to show people that Limpopo is the best province to be in South Africa," said Mosomane. The province will host the tournament at the state-of-the-art 45 000 capacity Peter Mokaba Stadium, where Greece, Argentina, Paraguay, New Zealand, France and Mexico will all play their first round matches. "I hope that fans will come in their numbers as we have played our part well. I assure them we are coining up a mirthful tournament for them," he said. The construction of the stadium, which started in March 2007, took 32 months to complete. It has already opened its doors to top-flight local teams, such as Kaizer Chiefs, Supersport United and Wits. The stadium has been built adjacent to the old stadium to form the Peter Mokaba Sports Complex. From its surroundings, the R1.3 billion development has created a landmark for the city and the entire province.
