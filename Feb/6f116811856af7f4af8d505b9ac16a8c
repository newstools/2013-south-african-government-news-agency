Pretoria - Gauteng train commuters are advised to use alternative transport following an unplanned strike by some train drivers. Metrorail spokesperson Sibusiso Ngomane said only a few train drivers affiliated to South African Transport and Allied Workers' Union (Satawu) were part of the strike. The strike, he said, was triggered by interventions rolled out by the management to improve efficiencies, optimize energy use and create capacity for improved reliability. Ngomane said the strike action would have an adverse effect on their operations and train scheduling, resulting in fewer trains available during this period. "We thus express deep appreciation to all employees for their commitment to service delivery and rallying behind our collective effort to overhaul Metrorail to deliver better services." He said Metrorail management remained open to further engagements and discussions with Satawu to resolve the current impasse. For more information on train service changes, commuters are advised to call the customer helpline on 0800 12 70 70.
