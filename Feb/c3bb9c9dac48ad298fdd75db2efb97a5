Pretoria - Ekurhuleni Mayor Ntombi Mekgwe has recommitted to protecting women and children, not only for 16 days but beyond the campaign. Addressing an ordinary council meeting on Thursday, Mekgwe called on communities to mobilise against the perpetrators of violence against women and children. "We call on all to recommit to eliminate violence against women, children and the most vulnerable in our communities as this is our collective responsibility as builders of a caring society that espouses respect, preservation and promotion of human value and dignity." For the next 16 days all sectors of South African society will be mobilised to act together against abuse and to support the victims and survivors of abuse. The 16 Days of Activism campaign is a partnership between government and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), faith-based organisations (FBOs), business, traditional leaders, state-owned enterprises (SoEs), civil society and the media to raise awareness about the abuse of women and children. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the campaign and stakeholders will be expected to take stock of the work done in the past decade and raise further awareness about the abuse of women and children. Moving on to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Mekgwe said the municipality is ready to welcome the guests to the biggest soccer spectacular on African soil. "We in the City of Ekurhuleni, like millions of South Africans are ready and poised to play our part in ensuring that South Africa and the African continent, deliver the most successful and the best ever Soccer World Cup, come 2010, which will leave a lasting legacy for our people." Mekgwe also extended best wishes to the national team - Bafana Bafana as they prepare for the 2010 Soccer World Cup. "We would like to assure the team that the entire country is behind them and we will be supporting them all the way."
