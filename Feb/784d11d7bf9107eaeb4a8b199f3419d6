Pretoria - Two houses in Block F West, Soshanguve, belonging to the suspects accused for the murder of Masego Kgomo, were torched by angry residents on Thursday evening. The angry community members are believed to have set the houses alight at around 10.30pm. The two houses were completely burnt down. Fortunately the occupants of the house had fled and no one was injured. A third house was saved through the intervention of the Tshwane Metro Police and the police. The incident follows the death of 10-year-old Masego, whose badly decomposed body was found near the Soshanguve Train Station on 8 January 2010 after she went missing. Three men were arrested for her murder and are alleged to have cut off some of her body parts, possibly for muti. Spokesperson for the Tshwane Community Safety Department, Console Tleane said the situation remained tense as the Tshwane Fire Brigade also remained on scene and on alert. He said one male was arrested for public violence. The three suspects in the case of Masego Kgomo are still in custody.
