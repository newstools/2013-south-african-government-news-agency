Pretoria - The Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality has announced that two of its licensing stations will no longer accept individual vehicle registration and renewal of vehicle licenses applications. The council's Community Safety Department said that as of Monday, the Akasia and Waltloo licensing stations in the east and north-west of the city centre would no longer accept or process individual applications for the registration and renewal of vehicle licenses. Only bulk applications by agents, car dealerships or any such bulk applications will be accepted. "The rationale behind this change is in order that we may achieve operational efficiencies. This was necessitated by the fact that around 80 percent of applications in the two stations were found to be bulk applications," said the department's spokesperson, Console Tleane. Tleane said that the need for change was also informed by the fact that the Post Office could now process vehicle renewals. Members of the public can still use the four other stations in the city, namely the Centurion Licensing Station; the Saambou Building on Andries Street in the city centre; the Skinner Street Drive-Through Licensing Station and the Laudium municipal offices. "We wish to assure residents that all four stations are fully operational and will process applications," he said.
