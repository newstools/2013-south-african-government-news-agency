Johannesburg - Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Khabisi Mosunkutu has warned protesters who engage in violent behaviour that the law will take its course. Orange Farm residents embarked on violent protest action on Monday, blocking off roads and burning tyres. They are unhappy about service delivery in their area. Mosunkutu said on Tuesday he will meet with commanders of the SAPS and Gauteng Metro Police to urge them to use the necessary measures to protect state property and the property of residents. He said while citizens had a right to embark on protest action - they should do so peacefully. "I wish to remind people who engage in violent protest action that law enforcement agents have an obligation to protect not only public and private property but also to defend those who do not wish to engage in any such protest actions. "It should be noted that barricading of public roads effectively denies innocent citizens of their right not to participate in the protest action," warned Mosunkutu.
