Cape Town - It's all systems go for what promises to be one of the most exciting FIFA Final Draws in history at the Cape Town International Convention Centre tonight. From 8pm, the eyes of the world will be fixed on South Africa for the nail-biting Final Draw, which will be hosted by Oscar-winning South African actress Charlize Theron and FIFA General Secretary Jerome Valcke. The event will be broadcast on SABC1 from 7pm, to capture the arrival of some of the event's top guests such as David Beckham and representatives from the 32 teams which has qualified. President Jacob Zuma and Local Organising Committee chairman Danny Jordaan are also expected to address the event. Over 3 000 international guests are expected at the Final Draw, which will be broadcasted live to an estimated audience of 200 million viewers in 200 countries. The live broadcast from Cape Town will be relayed on huge television screens in the pedestrian area between Buitensingel and Dorp Street. The festival stage is an exact replica of next year's FIFA Fan Fest stage which will be set up the Grand Parade. The star line-up will include well-known artists like FreshlyGround, Jimmy Dludlu and Flat Stanley. Cape Town's Long Street has been abuzz with activities since the early hours in anticipation of the Final Draw with people from all walks of life, singing and dancing to the melodies of the vuvuzela. Hundreds of foreign journalists have also descended onto the city, along with British soccer star David Beckham and other soccer greats who will be part of tonight's show. Other highlights include the world premier of the official mascot, Zakumi, buskers and carnival characters in football-themed outfits.
