Copenhagen - Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for the ongoing Copenhagen climate change talks to translate the emission cut commitments into practical measures. He said these measures should be fair for both developed nations that have industrialized and created the problem of climate change and developing nations that must now industrialize to lift their people out of poverty "Copenhagen is where we need to make a policy. It is time to lift this issue out of the realms of a campaign and put it firmly within the framework of a credible, achievable policy for change," said Blair. He suggested that Copenhagen should take the most ambitious level of commitments to cutting emissions. EU leaders recently agreed to reduce their emissions by 30 percent of 1990 levels. And the United States promised to cut emissions over the next decade "in the range of" 17 percent below 2005 levels. "These commitments fall short of what science tells us is necessary," said Blair. Meanwhile, he called for working more ways to accelerate the cut in emissions, such as the trans-border efforts to end exploitation of rainforests and energy efficiency, which saves massively on emissions.
