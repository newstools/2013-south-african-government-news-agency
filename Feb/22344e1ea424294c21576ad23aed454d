Johannesburg-LOC boss Danny Jordaan has appealed to soccer fans to remain silent during the singing of national anthems at match venues during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Jordaan was addressing reporters during a final pre-tournament stadium visit at Coca-Cola Park in Johannesburg where he also unveiled a commemorative plaque. "When we sing the national anthem, it must have the ambience and respect it deserves. We can't disrespect such an important part of a game by having unmitigated noise, so we ask people to please listen," he said. Jordaan also urged fans to do the same during today's friendly match between Bafana Bafana and Colombia at Soccer City. The LOC boss also urged fans to arrive at stadiums two hours before kick-off. FIFA General Secretary, Jerome Valcke described Coca-Cola Park as one of the country's greatest facilities ready for use during the show piece. Together with Jordaan he agreed that there will be a hive of activity when Nigeria opens their campaign against Argentina at the same venue on 12 June. The stadium, which hosted the epic opening and final of last year's FIFA Confederations Cup between Brazil and the United States of America, will also be used by eight other teams during the World Cup. The teams are Brazil, Korea Republic, Slovenia, USA, Spain, Honduras, Slovakia and Italy. The City of Joburg Mayoral Committee member, Bafana Sithole, said they have increased the stadia's seating capacity from 57 000 to 62 000. He further said they have also increased the parking facility at the stadia which hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup, when the Springboks beat New Zealand. The stadium has state-of-the-art media facilities, team whirlpools, accessibility for disabled fans, a new pitch and a top-notch audio-visual setup to keep fans informed during the game.
