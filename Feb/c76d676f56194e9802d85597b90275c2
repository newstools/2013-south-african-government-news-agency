Johannesburg - Gauteng Premier Nomvula Mokonyane has encouraged learners to utilise all opportunities presented to them during their school career. "Failure is not an option," Mokonyane told learners at the Kelekitso Secondary School in Meadowlands, Soweto. She said education was a priority for the country because without it, South Africa would always be a developing nation. All learners must work hard from the beginning of the year, despite any personal circumstances they might be facing. "It's all for you," said Mokonyane. She told teachers and parents of learners at the school that it was up to them to motivate pupils so that they successfully pass matric. They should also instil good values in them. Earlier in the day, Mokonyane and Education MEC Barbara Creecy visited Hlakaniphani Primary School in Dlamini, Soweto, where school uniforms were donated to needy learners. The delegation was expected to visit three schools in the area, before holding an education imbizo at the Orlando Community Hall.
