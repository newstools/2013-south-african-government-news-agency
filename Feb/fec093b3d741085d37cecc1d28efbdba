Pretoria - Eastgate Shopping Centre customers, businesses and residents in Bedfordview around the centre can now look forward to uninterrupted electricity supply. This as a result of a public-private partnership between the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality and Liberty Properties which led to the building of a state-of-the-art substation at the mall. Speaking at the opening of the substation on Thursday, Ekurhuleni Executive Mayor Ntombi Mekgwe hailed the successful completion of the project as "a strategic undertaking that will respond to not only today's but also future challenges". "This major upgrading of the electricity network will go a long way in strengthening the supply capacity at the shopping centre and for the surrounding residential areas," explained Mekgwe, adding that the project is in line with the metro's Electricity and Energy Network Master Plan. Liberty Properties Retail Director Mel Urdang described the initiative as a shining example of public and private partnership which will ensure a safe and pleasant shopping experience at mall. The R42 million substation consists of 2 x 30 MVA transformers, which will provide 30 MVA firm capacity.
