Pretoria - The Ekurhuleni Municipality has purchased a multi-million Rand dredging machine to rehabilitate its lakes, dams and wetlands which have deteriorated over time. The Watermaster Classic III, which costs R7.5 million, is the first of its kind in Gauteng. Known as the city of lakes, Ekurhuleni had faced numerous challenges with the state of its lakes recently. Ekurhuleni executive mayor, Clr Ntombi Mekgwe, said as a result, the council sourced a variety of opinions from wetlands specialist and environmental groups on the conditions of the lakes, dams and wetlands. "Eventually an agreement was reached that the Watermaster Classic III is the most suitable equipment to address the conditions of our lakes," Mekgwe said. The broader rehabilitation intervention measures include re-vegetation, erosion control structures, pathways/walkways control and removal of illegal dumping materials, among others. The mayor urged local communities to refrain from dumping general waste any unwanted objects in the wetlands, dams or even the storm water drainage systems as these objects end up polluting the lakes.
