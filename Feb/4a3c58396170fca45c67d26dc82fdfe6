Polokwane- As part of the Arrive Alive campaign, Limpopo radio stations have partnered with the provincial department of transport to ensure travellers heading to Zion City, Moria, are safe on the roads. Thobele FM, Munghana Lonene FM and Phalaphala FM will have mobile broadcasting vehicles stationed at various points of entry to the province to report on road safety and guide motorists on road activities and the weather. The marketing manager of Munghana Lonene FM, James Shikwambane, said: "We will be actively involved in the activities that will take place in the province during this Easter weekend. "Our main role is to warn those who will be travelling in and out of the province about road safety. We will also have periodical broadcasts about the activities that will be happening in Moria on Friday." Some DJs will be deployed in strategic areas in the province, where they will also distribute pamphlets on road safety, said Shikwambane.
