Pretoria - Four grandchildren of former President Nelson Mandela were attacked by armed men outside their home on the day the world was celebrating the 92-year-old's birthday. According to police, the children had just returned to the Athol residence with a driver and were getting out of the car when they were approached by two armed men on Sunday evening. "The men ordered the children and the driver to lie down. The suspects then decided to leave but changed their minds and went back to search the children and the driver. One of the suspects fired a shot and the driver returned fire. The suspects then fled the scene," police spokesman Brigadier Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said. Fortunately no one was injured in the incident and police said nothing was taken from the children or the driver. No arrests have been made as yet. "We are busy with investigations. We are investigating a case of attempted murder," Mariemuthoo said. Sunday's incident comes just a month after the Mandela family had to deal with the loss of one of the former President's great grandchildren. Thirteen-year-old Zenani was killed in a car accident after attending the 2010 FIFA World Cup Kick-off Concert in Orlando, Soweto.
