Pretoria - Energy Minister Dipuo Peters has urged South Africans to make their mark as day three of the public hearings into Eskom's proposed 35 percent tariff hike, kicks off. Peters said the hearings into the tariff application for the next three years provided a platform for the public to register concerns on the proposed hike. The power utility late last year revised its initial 45 percent tariff hike application to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to 35 percent. Eskom said the application was made to ensure power supply and to raise funds for its R385 billion power expansion programme. Public hearings into the tariff are for the first time being conducted countrywide with the regulator set to hear submissions in Kimberly in the Northern Cape today.
