Pretoria - The North West provincial government has committed itself to providing 14 000 houses for the 2010/2011 financial year to the most needy communities in the province. To achieve this, the province would accredit deserving municipalities in terms of the accreditation framework. "In order to accelerate the delivery of houses in terms of outcome eight of the national monitoring framework, we are going to accredit deserving municipalities in terms of the accreditation framework," said Premier Maureen Modiselle. Modiselle was delivering her State of the Province Address at the North West Provincial Legislature on Thursday. Thus far, the provincial government has provided 11 000 low-cost houses to the most destitute families. On education, Modiselle said the province would train subject advisors on subject content, an area that research has identified as being weak. In the drive to strengthen the teaching of Mathematics and Science in the province, government has in the past year supplied schools with various support materials worth R22.7 million. Modiselle said her government will continue with the refurbishment of laboratories and the special training of Mathematics and Science teachers. "Performance monitoring of the educational system will be spread across all levels and not only matric." Modiselle announced that they have identified school governance as an undermined variable in the performance of the education system. "In addressing this, we have inducted all new principals, introduced a practical leadership programme for principals as well as capacitating 953 school management teams to manage curriculum at school."
