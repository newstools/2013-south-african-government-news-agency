Durban - The Royal Reed Dance ceremony, a traditional event where Zulu maidens gather at King Goodwill Zwelithini's residence and perform a special dance for him, has attracted interest from international tourists and media wishing to attend. This year's event will take place on 11 and 12 September at the Enyokeni Royal Palace, in Nongoma. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Arts, Culture, Sport and Recreation, Weziwe Thusi, will attend the ceremony. Thousands of Zulu maidens from across the province participate in the Royal Reed Dance ceremony and present a reed to the King, symbolising their purity. On day two, different dances are performed by the young women from different villages in the province. KwaZulu-Natal Department of Arts, Culture and Sports said they had received numerous enquiries about the event. "The event, which gets bigger and better every year, is a major drawcard for international tourists and media, who are keen on getting information on the South African, particularly Zulu culture and way of life," said the department in a statement. This year's ceremony will see all the young women participating in the event undergoing life skills training. They will also be informed about moral regeneration and receive HIV and AIDS education, especially on prevention methods.
