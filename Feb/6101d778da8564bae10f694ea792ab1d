Bloemfontein - In an effort to create job security, Free State Premier Ace Magashule has encouraged businesses to use local skills. "We need to organise a cooperative of people who sew and as government we must support them and buy from them. Whenever a government department needs supplies they must turn to local companies. "If such cooperatives or companies are formed, we should embrace them as government. We should even go as far as to revive and reopen old and closed factories respectively," the premier said earlier this week. Magashule said supporting local businesses, would help grow the province's economy. He encouraged people to search for permanent employment, to be innovative and driven. Residents welcomed the premier's words, adding that while times were difficult, they would increase efforts to generate sustainable income.
