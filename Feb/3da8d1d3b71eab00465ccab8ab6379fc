Pretoria - The establishment of the Mining Industry Growth, Development and Employment Task Team (MIGDETT) has led to a mitigation of job losses in the mining industry from an initial estimated 100 000 to approximately 50 000. According to a joint release by government, labour and business in mining, MIGDETT effectively managed to mitigate the effects of the economic slowdown after its establishment in December 2008. At the time it was aimed at helping the industry manage the negative effects of the global economic crisis and to save jobs as well as to position the industry for growth and transformation in the medium- to long-term. However, following on its success and the slight economic recovery, the task team has decided to shift its focus to position the mining industry to achieve higher growth, the creation of decent jobs and transformation. This change in focus was decided at a meeting held on Friday convened by the Director General of the Department of Mineral Resources, Advocate Sandile Nogxina. At the meeting stakeholders further agreed that "a strategy for the sustainable growth and meaningful transformation of South Africa's mining sector" would be developed. This strategy will be developed by the collective under the auspices of MIGDETT and will culminate in a Mining Summit during March 2010.
