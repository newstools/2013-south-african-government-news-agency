Pretoria - The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has urged the public to ignore emails making rounds that the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (AARTO) has come into effect countrywide. According to the email, the AARTO was implemented from Sunday night. Under the system, motorists who commit offences will lose merit points. RTMC spokesperson Thandi Moya dismissed the email as false. "The rolling out of AARTO countrywide will indeed happen and the plans are at an advanced stage gearing for the national roll out. The exact day and hour of the national roll out will be confirmed and made public in due course," said Moya. Moya advised the public to refrain from taking any information on AARTO as fact unless articulated by the Department of Transport or RTMC as the source. "We call upon all members of the public to only entertain announcements made by the Department of Transport and the RTMC in this matter as these are the only centres with a legitimate and official voice on the facts surrounding AARTO and its implementation details," said Moya.
