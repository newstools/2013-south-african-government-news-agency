Pretoria - The validity of a learner's licence has been extended from 18 to 24 months and driving licence tests may now also be taken on Sundays. Transport Minister Sibusiso Ndebele made the much welcomed announcement on Monday. The minister published two notices to this effect in the Government Gazette on 17 February. In terms of the notices, the time for testing of drivers for motor vehicles has been extended to 5pm on Saturdays, and the inclusion of testing on Sundays from 7am to 1pm. "These measures form part of government's efforts to improve service delivery and will enable us to provide a better service to driving license applicants. It will also assist towards reducing the backlog with regards to driving licence applications," said Ndebele. He added that the department was working with provinces and municipalities to improve service delivery at the 371 testing centres countrywide. "We have also moved towards computerised licensing testing systems and have rolled out mobile and fixed stations in various parts of the country, the new computerised system is also assisting to root out fraud and corruption," he said. He urged driving licence applicants to make bookings for their tests well in advance, and not to wait for the last minute.
