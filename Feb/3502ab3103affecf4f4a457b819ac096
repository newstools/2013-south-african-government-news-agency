Kroonstad- More than 600 people heeded the Free State province's call to get tested for HIV when the province launched its HIV, Counselling and Testing (HCT) campaign on Friday. Health MEC, Sisi Mabe, said the province hopes to test over 960 000 people by June next year. "We are happy as a province and proud that so many people have heeded our call to come and make use of such services that are availed to better equip their lives," said Mabe. "Today I saw that a lot of people took an opportunity to come here get tested and get better informed," she added. Mabe emphasised the campaign's importance, adding that it was vital that people to know their status. She said the province has already received enthusiastic responses from religious leaders, youth groups and other community leaders and groups. Mabe said she hopes that by testing for the disease, it will encourage communities to do the same. "I think if people see us testing, it will reduce the stigma around testing," Mabe said. Resident David Maduna said he was excited about getting tested. "I don't want to live a life of assuming but rather live on facts," he said. He said by testing, he would also be able to encourage others to do the same
