Pretoria - The Gauteng Department of Education has assured parents and learners that all matriculants in the province will receive their results on the scheduled date of 7 January 2010. This has been confirmed by examination quality assurance statutory body, Umalusi, which on Monday said only matric results from Mpumalanga would be delayed. "Before the results are released, school principals are given a list of all learners whose results have been captured to verify that none of their learners are missing from that list. This is a quality assurance process and no teachers are involved in this verification," said Charles Phlahlane, spokesperson for Education MEC, Barbara Creecy. "Results will still be released even if this verification process is not done. The claim that learners might not get results without this verification is therefore untrue." Meanwhile, educators who are yet to receive their full Occupation Specific Dispensation have been requested to notify the department's Human Resource unit of any discrepancies so that they can be corrected. A full audit and verification process is planned for the early part of this year.
